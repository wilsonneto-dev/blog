## <a name="code-of-conduct"></a> Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].


## <a name="general-steps"></a> General Steps

1. Check if there is already an open issue for the subject.
2. Open an issue to discuss the new feature.
3. Fork this repository.
4. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature`.
5. Stage all changed files: `git add --all`.
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "feat: Add some feature"`.
7. Push to the branch: `git push origin feat/my-new-feature`.
8. Submit a pull request.


## <a name="commits-and-pull-requests"></a> Commits and Pull Requests

- :x: **AVOID** breaking the continuous integration build.
- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** make atomic commits to simplify reviewing.
- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** keep pull requests small so they can be easily reviewed.
- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** only commit using conventional commit patterns.


### <a name="conventional-commits"></a> Conventional Commits

To learn more about Conventional Commits, visit [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

In general, the pattern mostly looks like this:
```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  │       │             │
  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: *
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|build|test|ci|chore|merge|revert
```

Real world examples can look like this:
```
chore: run tests on travis ci
```
```
fix(server): send cors headers
```
```
feat(blog): add comment section
```

#### <a name="common-types"></a> Common types you can use (based on the Angular convention):

- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `build:` Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: npm, SDKs, etc.)
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `ci:` Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- `chore:` Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `merge:` Merge a branch into another branch
- `revert:` Reverts a previous commit


## <a name="coding-standards"></a> Coding Standards

- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** add XML or relevant documentation comments to new classes, methods, or parameters.
- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** add a test class for each feature and a test method for each scenario.
- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** use language conventions to keep the code easy to understand.
- :heavy_check_mark: **CONSIDER** using SOLID patterns.


## <a name="tests"></a> Tests

- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** add a unit test if your Pull Request resolves an issue or adds features.
- :heavy_check_mark: **CONSIDER** using test patterns like "AAA" and "Given When Then".
- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** add a test class for each feature and a test method for each assertion.
- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** make sure unit tests pass.
- :x: **AVOID** adding tests just to increase coverage on SonarCloud.
