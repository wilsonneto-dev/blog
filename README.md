# Personal Blog

Welcome to my personal blog! Here I share thoughts, ideas, experiences, and advice on topics that interest meâ€”mostly around software development, tech, and personal growth.

This blog is built using the awesome [Craft & Code Club's blog template](https://github.com/craft-code-club/blog-c3). Big thanks to them for the great foundation!

Feel free to explore, connect, and share.
